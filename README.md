# React Employee directory

The Goal here was to build a simple react Employee Directory Search using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). Didn't really have any issues with implementing the features required for this project.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
